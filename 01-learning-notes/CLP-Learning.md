# Learning Unit: CLP Regulation (Classification, Labelling & Packaging)

## 1. What Is CLP — In Plain Language

CLP stands for **Classification, Labelling and Packaging**.

In simple terms, CLP answers one fundamental question:

**How dangerous is this chemical, and how must that danger be communicated clearly and consistently?**

While REACH is about collecting and managing chemical knowledge,  
CLP is about communicating danger.

If REACH is the brain, CLP is the voice.

CLP applies across the entire EU and ensures that:
- hazards are identified using harmonised rules
- labels look the same in every Member State
- users immediately recognise risks, even across languages

---

## 2. Why the EU Needed CLP

Before CLP existed:
- countries classified chemicals differently
- labels varied widely
- hazard communication was inconsistent
- workers moving across borders faced confusion

The EU recognised a simple truth:

**A hazard that is communicated poorly is almost as dangerous as a hazard that is unknown.**

CLP was created to:
- harmonise hazard classification
- standardise labels and pictograms
- reduce accidents caused by misunderstanding
- support free movement of chemicals in the EU market

---

## 3. CLP’s Global Context

CLP is based on the **Globally Harmonised System (GHS)** developed by the United Nations.

This means:
- hazard logic is globally aligned
- pictograms are internationally recognisable
- EU companies can trade more easily worldwide

However:
- CLP is the EU’s legal implementation of GHS
- some requirements are stricter or more specific in the EU

---

## 4. Scope of CLP

CLP applies to:
- substances
- mixtures
- chemicals placed on the EU market

It covers chemicals that are:
- manufactured in the EU
- imported into the EU
- supplied to professional or consumer users

CLP applies **before and at the moment of placing on the market**.

---

## 5. What CLP Does NOT Do

CLP does not:
- approve chemicals
- ban chemicals by itself
- assess exposure scenarios
- decide whether a substance may be used

CLP answers **“how dangerous is it?”**, not **“should it be used?”**.

---

## 6. Objective of CLP

The main objective of CLP is:

**To ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment by ensuring that chemical hazards are clearly identified and communicated.**

This protection is achieved through:
- clear labels
- standard pictograms
- harmonised hazard statements
- consistent SDS information

CLP is therefore a **preventive regulation**.

---

## 7. How CLP Works (High-Level Logic)

CLP follows a three-step structure:

1. Classification  
2. Labelling  
3. Packaging  

This order is fixed and intentional.

---

## 8. Classification

Classification means:
- evaluating available hazard data
- applying legally defined criteria
- assigning hazard classes and categories

Hazards fall into three main groups:
- physical hazards
- health hazards
- environmental hazards

Classification is rule-based and legally binding.

Once classification is determined, everything else flows from it.

---

## 9. Labelling

Labelling translates scientific classification into visible warnings.

A CLP label includes:
- hazard pictograms
- signal words (Danger / Warning)
- hazard statements
- precautionary statements

The purpose of the label is **instant hazard recognition**.

---

## 10. Packaging

Packaging ensures that:
- containers do not leak
- closures prevent accidental opening
- packaging materials are compatible
- child-resistant closures are used where required
- tactile warnings are present for visually impaired users

Packaging is part of hazard communication, not just logistics.

---

## 11. Relationship Between CLP and SDS

CLP and SDS are directly linked:
- CLP defines the hazard classification
- SDS Section 2 communicates that classification
- other SDS sections expand on its consequences

If CLP classification is wrong, SDS information becomes unreliable.

---

## 12. Relationship Between CLP and REACH

CLP and REACH are separate regulations but work together:

- REACH generates hazard and use data
- CLP classifies and labels hazards
- SDS communicates both to the supply chain

Together, they form a complete chemicals safety system.

---

## 13. Why CLP Matters in Practice

Correct CLP classification:
- prevents workplace accidents
- ensures correct PPE selection
- supports emergency response
- protects consumers
- reduces environmental harm
- protects companies from legal risk

Many enforcement actions arise from **misclassification**, not hidden hazards.

---

## 14. System Mental Model

Think of the system as:

Scientific data  
→ CLP classification  
→ Labels and SDS  
→ Safe handling and use

---

## 15. One-Sentence Summary

**CLP ensures that chemical hazards are identified using harmonised rules and communicated clearly through labels and SDS so risks can be recognised and managed across the EU.**
