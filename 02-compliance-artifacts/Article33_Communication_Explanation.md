# Article 33 Communication – Customer Explanation Artifact

## Purpose of This Document

This document demonstrates the ability to explain REACH Article 33 obligations in clear, non-technical language suitable for customers, buyers, and non-chemical stakeholders.

It complements the formal Article 33 declaration by translating regulatory requirements into understandable communication.

---

## What Article 33 Requires (Internal Understanding)

Under REACH Article 33, a supplier must inform recipients if an article contains a Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) above 0.1% weight by weight.

The obligation is a communication duty, not a ban and not a safety alert.

---

## Simple Customer Explanation (Primary Message)

> This product contains a substance that the European Union has identified as potentially concerning in the long term.  
> The presence of this substance does not make the product unsafe during normal use.  
> We are sharing this information to comply with EU transparency requirements and to support responsible supply chain decisions.

## Expanded Explanation (If Customer Asks More)

### What is an SVHC?
An SVHC is a substance flagged by regulators because of potential long-term environmental or health concerns.  
It does not automatically mean the product is dangerous.

### Is the product safe to use?
Yes. The product is compliant and safe for its intended use.  
The notification exists to ensure transparency, not because immediate risk exists.

### Why are you telling us?
EU law requires suppliers to share this information so companies can make informed decisions during use, recycling, or resale.

### Do we need to take action?
Usually no special action is required for normal use.  
However, the information should be passed along if the product is supplied further in the supply chain.

## Key Communication Principles Demonstrated

- Be transparent but calm
- Avoid alarming language
- Do not hide regulatory facts
- Distinguish hazard from risk
- Emphasise compliance and responsibility

---

## What Should NOT Be Said

Avoid statements like:
- “The product is dangerous”
- “There is a safety issue”
- “You should stop using it”

Unless separate safety regulations require it, Article 33 communication is informational, not an emergency notice.

---

## One-Sentence Professional Summary

Article 33 communication informs customers about substances of concern to support transparency and lifecycle responsibility, not to indicate unsafe use.
