# Supplier REACH Questionnaire – Risk Mapping Artifact

## Purpose of This Document

This document explains the regulatory purpose behind each section of the Supplier REACH Questionnaire.

The goal is to demonstrate that supplier questions are not administrative forms, but **risk control measures** supporting compliance with:

- REACH registration obligations
- CLP classification accuracy
- SDS reliability
- SVHC and restriction requirements

## 1. Registration Questions → Market Legality Risk

| Supplier Question | Compliance Risk Controlled | Regulatory Area |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Are substances registered under REACH? | Illegal placement on EU market | REACH Registration |
| Provide registration number | False compliance claims | REACH Registration |
| Is an Only Representative appointed? | Importer becomes registrant unknowingly | REACH Importer Duties |
| Are any substances exempt? | Incorrect exemption reliance | REACH Scope |
| Annual tonnage information | Wrong tonnage band obligations | REACH Data Requirements |

### Why This Matters
Registration determines whether the substance can legally be sold.  
Failure here leads to immediate enforcement and product withdrawal.

## 2. Classification Questions → Hazard Communication Risk

| Supplier Question | Compliance Risk Controlled | Regulatory Area |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Is the substance classified under CLP? | Missing hazard identification | CLP Classification |
| Is classification harmonised or self-classified? | Incorrect classification choice | CLP Annex VI |
| Are labels compliant with CLP? | Incorrect hazard communication | CLP Labelling |
| Does classification match SDS Section 2? | Conflicting safety information | CLP ↔ SDS Consistency |

### Why This Matters
Incorrect classification leads to incorrect labels and unsafe use downstream.

---

## 3. SDS Questions → Operational Safety & Liability Risk

| Supplier Question | Compliance Risk Controlled | Regulatory Area |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| SDS provided? | No hazard communication | REACH Article 31 |
| SDS EU compliant format? | Invalid documentation | REACH Annex II |
| Latest revision date? | Outdated hazard information | SDS Updating Duty |
| Exposure scenarios included? | Improper use conditions | Extended SDS |
| Language compliance? | Users cannot understand hazards | Supply Chain Communication |

### Why This Matters
SDS is the primary document inspectors review first.  
Incorrect SDS = immediate compliance concern.

---

## 4. SVHC Questions → Transparency & Future Risk

| Supplier Question | Compliance Risk Controlled | Regulatory Area |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Contains SVHC? | Hidden regulatory obligations | Candidate List |
| Concentration above 0.1%? | Missing Article 33 duty | Article 33 Communication |
| SCIP notification provided? | Waste framework violation | SCIP Database |
| Candidate list monitored? | Outdated product status | Ongoing Compliance |

### Why This Matters
SVHC issues rarely cause immediate bans but create major future business risk.

---

## 5. Restriction Questions → Market Access Risk

| Supplier Question | Compliance Risk Controlled | Regulatory Area |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Subject to restrictions? | Illegal product placement | Annex XVII |
| Conditions respected? | Partial compliance | Use Restrictions |
| Authorisation required? | Future prohibition risk | Annex XIV |

### Why This Matters
A restricted substance may be registered but still illegal for specific uses.

---

## Integrated Compliance Logic

Each supplier answer feeds a different compliance layer:

Registration → legality  
Classification → hazard identification  
SDS → safe use  
SVHC → transparency  
Restriction → market permission

If one fails, the product may still appear compliant but is legally vulnerable.

## One-Line Professional Summary

**Supplier information is not collected to trust the supplier, but to verify regulatory control across the entire chemical lifecycle.**
