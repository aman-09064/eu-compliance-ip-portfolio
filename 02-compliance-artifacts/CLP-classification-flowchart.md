# CLP Classification Flowchart (Compliance Artifact)

## Purpose of This Flowchart

This flowchart illustrates the **decision-making logic under the CLP Regulation** for:
- classifying substances and mixtures
- determining labelling requirements
- ensuring correct hazard communication

It focuses on **process flow**, not legal citations.

## CLP Classification & Communication Flow

START  
⬇️  

### 1. Substance or Mixture Identified
- Chemical identity confirmed
- Composition known
- Substance or mixture clearly defined

⬇️  

### 2. Is the Chemical Placed on the EU Market?
- Manufactured in the EU  
- Imported into the EU  

If **NO** → CLP does not apply  
If **YES** → continue

⬇️  

### 3. Hazard Data Available?
Sources may include:
- REACH registration data
- Scientific literature
- Test reports
- Supplier information
- Data sharing

If **NO** →  
- Data gap identified  
- Classification cannot be completed  

If **YES** → continue

⬇️  

### 4. Determine Substance or Mixture
- Substance → classify directly  
- Mixture → apply mixture classification rules  

⬇️  

### 5. Apply CLP Classification Criteria
Evaluate hazards using CLP rules:

- Physical hazards  
- Health hazards  
- Environmental hazards  

Assign:
- Hazard classes  
- Hazard categories  

⬇️  

### 6. Is Harmonised Classification Available?
- Listed in CLP Annex VI?

If **YES** →  
- Mandatory classification applied  

If **NO** →  
- Self-classification performed  

⬇️  

### 7. Final CLP Classification Confirmed
- Classification documented
- Decision justified
- Consistent across systems

⬇️  

### 8. Generate Label Elements
Based on classification:
- Hazard pictograms  
- Signal word (Danger / Warning)  
- Hazard statements  
- Precautionary statements  

⬇️  

### 9. Update Safety Data Sheet (SDS)
- Section 2 aligned with CLP classification
- Label elements included
- Hazard communication consistent

⬇️  

### 10. Packaging Requirements Checked
- Suitable packaging material
- Child-resistant closures (if required)
- Tactile warnings (if required)

⬇️  

### 11. Place on the EU Market
- Label attached
- SDS supplied
- Downstream users informed

⬇️

## Key Compliance Notes

- CLP classification is **legally binding**
- Incorrect classification invalidates SDS Section 2
- Labels, SDS, and notifications must be consistent
- Classification must be updated if new hazard data becomes available

---

## How This Flowchart Is Used

This flowchart supports:
- CLP compliance checks
- SDS preparation and review
- Supplier qualification
- Internal audits
- Training and onboarding
- Inspection readiness

---

## One-Line System Summary

**REACH generates hazard data → CLP classifies hazards → SDS and labels communicate risks → users apply safety measures**
